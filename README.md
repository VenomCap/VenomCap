# VenomCap sequence capture probe-set 

Welcome to the VenomCap GitHub repository! Provided here are the bait sequences that are needed for probe capture, and the marker files that would be needed for data analysis.   

The probe set is freely available for all to use with no restrictions with an aim to be collaborative and update the probe set as new information is discovered. As new studies are published and if new venom markers are designed, researchers can contribute these additional markers by creating a new branch from this repository and we will merge them together upon further review. 

For basic data analysis, please use the new R packages PhyloProcessR and PhyloConfigR for updated data analysis pipelines. However, a pipeline to analyse the paralogs is still under development.

# VenomCap sequence capture probe-set 

Welcome to the VenomCap GitHub repository! Provided here are the bait sequences that are needed for probe capture, and the marker files that would be needed for data analysis.   

For basic data analysis, please use the new R packages PhyloProcessR and PhyloConfigR for updated data analysis pipelines. However, a pipeline to analyse the paralogs is still under development.
